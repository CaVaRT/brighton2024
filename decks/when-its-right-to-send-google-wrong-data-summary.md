## Key Takeaways

1. Evolution of Google Ads:
   - Numerous game-changing releases since 2015 (Customer Match, ETAs, PMax, etc.)
   - Increasing reliance on AI (RSAs, PMax, potential future keywordless campaigns)
   - Control taken away from advertisers (exact match changes, search terms restrictions, etc.)

2. Changing role of PPC professionals:
   - From PPC teachers to PPC doctors to PPC pilots
   - Increased focus on data management and strategic decision-making

3. The challenge of balancing efficiency and growth:
   - Clients want improved ROAS, lower CPC and CPA, without cutting volume
   - Traditional solutions (bid strategies, ad copy, keyword mix) may not always suffice

4. Case study: Strategically editing conversion value data
   - Problem: CPC and CPA inflation due to unusually high-value bookings
   - Solution: Capped the value distribution at the 95th percentile
   - Result: 26% increase in ROAS, 9% decrease in CPC, 13% decrease in CPA

5. Concept of Perverse Incentives:
   - Historical examples: Great Hanoi Rat Massacre, Four Pests Campaign
   - In PPC: How sending "correct" data can lead to undesired outcomes

6. The importance of strategic data management:
   - What you choose to tell (and not tell) Google is fundamental
   - Balancing first-party data, COGS, budget, etc. against Google's AI-driven features

## Action Items

1. Analyze your conversion value distribution:
   - Identify any outliers or unusual patterns that might be skewing your data

2. Hypothesize potential perverse incentives in your account:
   - Look for situations where "correct" data might lead to undesired outcomes

3. Consider testing value capping strategies:
   - Identify high-percentile conversion values that might be inflating CPCs
   - Develop a hypothesis for how capping these values might impact performance

4. Implement a controlled test of value capping:
   - Apply value capping to a portion of your account or campaigns
   - Monitor key metrics (ROAS, CPC, CPA, conversion volume) closely

5. Analyze the results of your test:
   - Compare performance metrics before and after implementing value capping
   - Assess whether the strategy improved overall efficiency without significant volume loss

6. Review your data sharing strategy with Google:
   - Evaluate what data you're currently sharing and its impact on performance
   - Consider if there are areas where sharing less or modified data might be beneficial

7. Stay informed about Google Ads updates:
   - Regularly review new features and changes to understand how they might impact your control over campaigns

8. Develop a framework for identifying and addressing perverse incentives:
   - Create a process for regularly reviewing account performance for unexpected outcomes
   - Establish guidelines for when and how to intervene with data manipulation strategies

9. Educate your team or clients about this approach:
   - Explain the concept of strategic data management and its potential benefits
   - Emphasize the importance of hypothesis-driven testing and careful monitoring

Remember: This strategy may not work for all businesses. Always start with a clear hypothesis, test carefully, and closely monitor results. The goal is to find a balance that improves overall performance while maintaining the integrity of your advertising efforts.
