3. Analyze and split congested ad groups into more focused, themed groups.

4. Ensure ad text closely matches the keywords in each ad group.

5. Experiment with different CTAs from your landing pages in your ad copy.

6. Regularly review and pause zero impression keywords with low Quality Scores (<=5).

7. Identify and pause keywords with very low Quality Scores (<4) and 'Below average' Ad Relevance.

8. Monitor your average CPC and overall traffic after implementing these changes.

9. Continuously work on improving your Quality Score to potentially lower costs and increase ad performance.

10. For Google Ads Grant accounts, pay special attention to these metrics to maximize the impact of the grant.
