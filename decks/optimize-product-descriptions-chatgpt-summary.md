## Key Takeaways

1. Custom GPTs for Product Descriptions:
   - Custom GPTs are personalized versions of ChatGPT trained with specific data and instructions.
   - Creating custom GPTs for each product brand improves content quality and reduces hallucinations.

2. Creating Custom GPTs:
   - Scrape product & category descriptions and 'About Us' pages for training data.
   - Provide well-defined instructions and context to the GPT.
   - Instruct the GPT to avoid hallucinations and ask for more information when needed.

3. Prompt Structure for Product Descriptions:
   - Include product name, brand context, and language specifications.
   - Request specific sections like product info, use cases, and target audience.
   - Format instructions (e.g., HTML, subheadings) and SEO optimization guidelines.

4. Results of Custom GPT Usage:
   - 400 products optimized in 5 weeks.
   - 115 more words in position 1 in Google.
   - 156% more organic clicks after 5 weeks.

5. Automating the Process with Make.com:
   - Connect apps like Google Sheets with ChatGPT to build automated workflows.
   - No coding knowledge required.
   - Achieved 3,500 product descriptions in one day or 40 descriptions in 5 minutes.

6. Make.com Workflow:
   - Use Google Sheets for input data (URL, Product name, short info).
   - Set up ChatGPT interactions for long and short descriptions.
   - Output results to separate Google Sheets.

7. Importing Optimized Descriptions:
   - For WordPress sites, use All Import - WooCommerce Import Add-On Pro plugin.

## Action Items

   - Create custom GPTs for each product brand using ChatGPT's GPT editor.

2. Develop Effective Prompts:
   - Structure prompts with clear instructions, context, and formatting guidelines.
   - Include examples in prompts for better results.

3. Test and Refine:
   - Start by optimizing a small batch of products to test the custom GPT's effectiveness.
   - Analyze results and refine prompts as needed.

4. Implement Make.com Automation:
   - Set up a Make.com account and create a new scenario.
   - Connect Google Sheets and ChatGPT modules.
   - Configure the workflow to read input data, generate descriptions, and output results.

5. Prepare Data Sheets:
   - Create input Google Sheets with necessary product information.
   - Set up output sheets for long and short descriptions.

6. Run and Monitor Automation:
   - Start with a small batch to ensure everything works correctly.
   - Scale up to larger product sets once confident in the process.

7. Import Optimized Descriptions:
   - For WordPress/WooCommerce sites, set up the All Import plugin.
   - Configure import settings to match your data structure.

8. Continuous Improvement:
   - Regularly review generated descriptions for quality and accuracy.
   - Update custom GPTs and prompts based on performance and any changes in brand guidelines.
