## Key Takeaways

1. The Challenge:
   - Onboarded in 2022, migration in 2024
   - 50 markets, 7 domains
   - Over 150,000 pages migrating

2. Automation:
   - Used OnCrawl and DPO for automated reporting
   - 9-month preparation period

3. Setting the Foundations:
   - Focus on EEAT (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)
   - Agile and flexible approach
   - Iterative testing process: Audit > Jira > Deploy

4. Challenges:
   - Numerous meetings
   - Increase in Jira tickets

5. Migration Results and Issues:
   - Google crawling during switchover showed 3xx, 500, and 200 status codes
   - Issues encountered: 404s from redirects, 404s in hreflang, 500s from feeds

6. Real-time Problem Solving:
   - Flexible approach allowed for regex-based redirects
   - Real-time fixes implemented based on log file data

7. Importance of Log Files:
   - Enabled identification and quick resolution of issues like hreflang 404 spikes
   - Crucial for detecting 500 errors from feeds

8. Positive Outcomes:
   - PDP Results: +13% Impressions, +18% Clicks
   - Significant improvements in overall performance (20% to 50% increase mentioned)

## Action Items

1. Implement Automated Reporting:
   - Set up tools like OnCrawl and DPO for continuous monitoring
   - Ensure reporting is in place well before migration (9 months in this case)

2. Adopt an Agile Approach:
   - Develop a flexible migration strategy that allows for quick adjustments
   - Implement an iterative testing process (Audit > Jira > Deploy)

3. Prioritize Log File Analysis:
   - Set up robust log file monitoring before, during, and after migration
   - Train team members on interpreting log file data for quick issue identification

4. Develop Real-time Response Capabilities:
   - Create a system for implementing real-time fixes based on log file data
   - Prepare regex-based redirect solutions for flexibility during migration

5. Focus on Key SEO Elements:
   - Pay special attention to redirects, hreflang implementation, and feed performance
   - Regularly audit these elements throughout the migration process

6. Optimize Meeting Efficiency:
   - Review and streamline meeting schedules to avoid unnecessary gatherings
   - Ensure meetings have clear objectives and actionable outcomes

7. Enhance Developer Collaboration:
   - Strengthen communication channels between SEO and development teams
   - Involve developers early in the migration planning process

8. Implement Comprehensive Monitoring:
   - Set up monitoring for various status codes (3xx, 404, 500) across all migrated pages
   - Create alerts for unexpected spikes in error codes

9. Prepare for Common Migration Issues:
   - Develop contingency plans for typical migration problems (e.g., redirect chains, hreflang errors)
   - Create troubleshooting guides for quick reference during migration

10. Post-Migration Analysis:
    - Conduct thorough performance analysis post-migration (impressions, clicks, rankings)
    - Document learnings and create a playbook for future migrations

Remember: The key to a successful migration lies in thorough preparation, automated monitoring, real-time problem-solving capabilities, and a flexible approach that allows for quick adjustments based on log file data and other real-time insights.
