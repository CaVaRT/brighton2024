## Key Takeaways

1. Content Audit Process:
   - Organize your database (crawl, content, metrics)
   - Understand the data (categorize your inventory)
   - Evaluate performance and assign action items
   - Organize your deliverable (prioritized recommendations)

2. Data Collection and Organization:
   - Crawl and scrape content efficiently, especially for large sites
   - Map important performance metrics (user engagement, traffic, search data)
   - Include custom metrics for deeper insights

3. Data Understanding and Categorization:
   - Use ML APIs for content classification (e.g., Google's Natural Language API)
   - Implement topic modeling techniques like LDA or BERTopic for subtopic identification
   - Utilize entity recognition for mapping entities to topics

4. Content Evaluation:
   - Automate checks for content helpfulness and EEAT (Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)
   - Implement semantic analysis for better content understanding
   - Use custom metrics like keyword density, entity density, and topic relevance

5. Performance Evaluation and Action Items:
   - Create a system of if/else logic for consistent evaluation
   - Assign action items and responsible persons/departments for each assessment
   - Utilize tools like Looker Studio for visualizations and Zapier for automations

6. Deliverable Organization:
   - Create immediately actionable, extensive, and insightful reports
   - Contextualize findings for multiple stakeholder groups
   - Include downloadable lists with all relevant data, actions, and roles

## Action Items

1. Implement ML APIs:
   - Set up Google's Natural Language API for content classification
   - Explore topic modeling techniques like LDA or BERTopic
   - Implement entity recognition for improved content understanding

2. Enhance Data Collection:
   - Review and optimize crawling processes, especially for large sites
   - Expand metric collection to include custom and advanced metrics

3. Develop Automated Checks:
   - Create a checklist of best practices for content evaluation
   - Translate checklist items into if/else statements and code
   - Implement automated checks for EEAT factors where possible

4. Improve Semantic Analysis:
   - Develop custom metrics for keyword density, entity density, and topic relevance
   - Implement tools like KeyBert for query-content matching

5. Set Up Visualization Tools:
   - Create Looker Studio dashboards for ongoing content performance monitoring
   - Use Zapier to set up automated notifications for underperforming content

6. Refine Deliverable Format:
   - Review and optimize audit report structure for actionability and stakeholder relevance
   - Include clear sections on importance, responsible parties, and downloadable action lists

7. Continuous Improvement:
   - Aim to make the auditing process 1% better with each iteration
   - Explore advanced techniques like SERP analysis, competitor content audits, and cross-platform opportunity analysis
