## Key Takeaways

1. Three Core Areas of Bias in Data Visualization:
   - Data
   - Cognitive
   - Visual

2. Data Bias:
   - Survivorship bias often occurs due to incomplete datasets
   - Understanding accuracy and precision helps identify survivorship bias
   - Critical thinking is crucial to identify the extent of survivorship bias

3. Cognitive Bias:
   - The human brain processes 35,000 decisions daily, leading to cognitive shortcuts
   - Key cognitive biases:
     a. Framing effect
     b. Causal illusion
     c. Anchoring effect

4. Visual Bias:
   - Can be mitigated with a high level of control
   - Key visual biases:
     a. Scale manipulation
     b. Correlation illusion
     c. Visual distortion
     d. Color choice

5. Accessibility in Data Visualization:
   - Critical for mitigating visual bias
   - Key accessibility features:
     a. Data markers
     b. Patterns
     c. Alt text
     d. Tables and shapes

## Action Items

1. Assess Data Quality:
   - Evaluate datasets for completeness and potential survivorship bias
   - Use accuracy and precision metrics to understand data quality

2. Implement Critical Thinking:
   - Develop a framework for critically assessing data, especially for sources like Google Analytics

3. Address Cognitive Biases:
   - Be aware of framing effects when presenting data
   - Avoid implying causation without proper evidence
   - Provide full context to mitigate anchoring effects

4. Improve Visual Representations:
   - Use appropriate scales in charts to avoid trend exaggeration
   - Be cautious with trend lines and ensure they accurately represent data
   - Choose chart types that minimize visual distortion (e.g., bar charts over pie charts)

5. Enhance Color Usage:
   - Select colors that don't introduce cognitive biases
   - Ensure color choices are accessible to all users, including those with color vision deficiencies

6. Implement Accessibility Features:
   - Add symbol markers to charts for visual distinction
   - Use patterns in bar charts to differentiate data points
   - Provide alt text for all data visuals
   - Use tables and shapes to aid in data comprehension

7. Practice Balanced Reporting:
   - Present both positive and negative aspects of data trends
   - Include relevant context when showcasing improvements or declines

8. Verify Correlations:
   - Use statistical methods (e.g., p-values) to confirm correlations before presenting them
   - Investigate potential confounding variables in apparent correlations

9. Standardize Visualization Practices:
   - Develop guidelines for data visualization within your organization
   - Ensure consistent timeframes and scales when comparing data

10. Continuous Learning:
    - Stay updated on best practices in data visualization
    - Regularly review and update your visualization techniques

Remember: While we cannot eliminate bias entirely, we can work to uncover and mitigate it through careful analysis, thoughtful presentation, and accessible design in our data visualizations.
