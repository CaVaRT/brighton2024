## Introduction
- The University of Cambridge faces challenges with an overgrown website
- Risks include duplicate content and a complex web of institutions
- The web estate is huge and growing, with over 2,500 sites and 2 million web pages

## Current Situation
- Websites are locally optimized
- Over 1,300 editors contribute to the content
- The vast amount of content makes it difficult for search engines and users to find relevant information

## SEO Approach
- Focus on making it easier for users, which in turn makes it easier for search engines
- Example: Searching for study costs can lead to incorrect or incomplete information

## Strategy for Content Retirement

### 1. Prioritize and Reduce
- Find content owners
- Don't work alone; involve stakeholders
- Get data: Implement Google Analytics 4 on everything
- Use Google Tag Manager with Lookup Table variable

### 2. Inventory and Audit
- Start crawling the entire web estate
- Be ruthless in content evaluation
- Be aware of additive bias (easy to add, hard to remove)

### 3. Archive
- Make archiving less scary for content owners

### 4. Establish Clear Criteria
Example criteria:
- For content from last year:
  - If views < 366, then delete
  - Else, review

### 5. Use ROT (Redundant, Obsolete, Trivial) Analysis
- Redundant: Duplicate or unnecessary content
- Obsolete: Outdated information
- Trivial: Content with little to no value in the last 12 months

### 6. Data-Driven Decisions
- Use formulas like:
  For content published > 10 years:
  - If ROT = true, then delete
  - Else, review

### 7. Tools and Techniques
- Use IMPORTXML function for data extraction
- Utilize Screaming Frog's Custom extraction & GA4 API for custom crawls
- Export data and use conditional formatting to target content for removal

### 8. Implementation
- Take out easy targets first
- Redirect users from removed content to relevant pages
- Develop a URL and domain strategy
