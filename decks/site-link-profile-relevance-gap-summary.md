## Key Takeaways

1. Google's Treatment of Links:
   - Google is ignoring many links, especially those that are "mismatched" or irrelevant.
   - In rare cases, irrelevant links can harm a site's visibility.

2. Importance of Link Relevance:
   - Irrelevant links can skew the topicality of your link profile.
   - Relevance is the best lever to pull for digital PR success in SEO.

3. Definition of Relevance:
   - Being relevant means being closely connected.
   - A link is relevant when the topics of the linking page match one or more topics of the site's content.

4. Measuring Link Relevance:
   - Objective measurement of link relevance is possible and crucial.
   - DIGITALOFT's solution analyzes topics of both site content and link profile.

5. Relevance Gaps:
   - A relevance gap occurs when there's a mismatch between the topics your site is about and what your link profile suggests.
   - Addressing relevance gaps can involve earning more relevant links or removing irrelevant ones.

6. E-E-A-T and Relevance:
   - E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) is closely related to relevance.
   - E-E-A-T can be thought of as your site's reputation, which influences trust.

7. Importance of Context:
   - Relevance should be considered at the content, author, and brand levels, both on-page and off-page.

## Action Items

1. Analyze Your Link Profile:
   - Use tools or services to objectively measure the relevance of your link profile.
   - Identify topics where your site has a relevance gap.

2. Address Relevance Gaps:
   - For topics with relevance gaps, focus on earning more relevant links.
   - Consider removing irrelevant links that may be skewing your link profile.

3. Maintain Relevance in Strong Areas:
   - For topics where you have no relevance gap, continue your current strategies to defend your position.

4. Redefine "Good Links":
   - Open discussions about what constitutes a "good link" for your site based on relevance, not just metrics like DA/DR.

5. Prioritize Content vs. Links:
   - Use relevance insights to determine whether your priority focus should be on content creation or link building.

6. Align Digital PR with Relevance:
   - Use data-driven insights to inform digital PR ideation.
   - Plan PR activities around closing identified relevance gaps.

7. Enhance E-E-A-T:
   - Focus on improving your site's Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness.
   - Consider E-E-A-T at the content, author, and brand levels.

8. Monitor On-Page and Off-Page Factors:
   - Ensure relevance is maintained both in your on-site content and off-site signals (like backlinks).

9. Continuous Measurement:
   - Regularly assess your site's relevance profile to identify and address new gaps or changes over time.

Remember: Link relevance is crucial for SEO success. By objectively measuring and addressing relevance gaps, you can improve your site's visibility and authority in the eyes of search engines.
