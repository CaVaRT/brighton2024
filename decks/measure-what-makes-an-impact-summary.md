## Key Takeaways

1. Measuring What Matters is Hard Work:
   - Many metrics can be measured, but only a few are pertinent to your company.
   - Don't obsess over sampled data; slight discrepancies often don't dramatically shift budgets or efforts.
   - Transactional data must be 100% correct, but analytical data can be fuzzy.

2. Be Pragmatic with Data:
   - Focus on gaining actionable insights, even if the data isn't perfect.
   - Data pragmatism means tailoring analysis to meet specific business needs.
   - Present data in a way that triggers action in stakeholders.

3. Rely on Trend Analysis:
   - Directional reporting can inform decision-making without perfect data.
   - Tools like Google Trends, Exploding Topics, and AlsoAsked.com can help monitor trends.
   - Three main types: Comparative analysis, Regression analysis, and Time-series analysis.

4. Create Your Own Metrics:
   - Focus on metrics that align with your company's unique value and goals.
   - Example: Spotify's 6,000 music genres for optimal recommendations.
   - Consider creating modified weighted systems to reflect combined goals (e.g., SEO & PPC baseline).

5. Blueprint for Getting Started:
   1. Articulate the challenge
   2. Define custom metrics
   3. Assemble the data sources
   4. Identify patterns
   5. Communicate trends & drive action

6. Example: Digital Happiness Index
   - Combines metrics like page load speed, high-value orders placed, return purchases, add to wishlist actions, and five-star reviews.

## Action Items

1. Audit your current metrics: Identify which ones truly impact your business decisions.

2. Develop a data pragmatism mindset: Focus on actionable insights rather than perfect data.

3. Implement trend analysis in your reporting:
   - Use tools like Google Trends, Exploding Topics, and AlsoAsked.com.
   - Apply comparative, regression, and time-series analyses as appropriate.

4. Brainstorm custom metrics that align with your business goals:
   - Consider combining existing metrics in new ways.
   - Think about what unique value your company provides and how to measure it.

5. Create a "Digital Happiness Index" or similar composite metric for your business:
   - Identify 3-5 key metrics that reflect customer satisfaction and business success.
   - Develop a formula to combine these metrics into a single index.

6. Set up a system to regularly assemble data from various sources:
   - Include Google Ads, Google Search Console, CRUX data, and Google Merchant Center data.

7. Develop a process for identifying patterns in your data:
   - Look for correlations between different metrics.
   - Pay attention to seasonal trends and emerging keywords.

8. Improve your data communication:
   - Create visualizations that clearly show trends and patterns.
   - Frame insights in terms of actionable steps for stakeholders.

9. Regularly review and refine your custom metrics and analysis processes.

10. Consider exploring trend analysis in BigQuery for more advanced insights.

Remember: The goal is to measure what truly impacts your business, not just what's easy to measure. Be pragmatic, focus on trends, and don't be afraid to create custom metrics that reflect your unique business goals.
